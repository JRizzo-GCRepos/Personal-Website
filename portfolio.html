<h3>Description</h3>
<p> 
    Having recently graduated from Grand Circus, I am an enthusiastic and highly motivated individual who can
    absorb skills rapidly. I am looking to change the trajectory of my career by switching to an ever evolving field
    with opportunities for advancement, which my current position does not offer. Capable of communicating
    across teams as well as being self-driven, I bring a positive attitude and a passion for learning to the table.

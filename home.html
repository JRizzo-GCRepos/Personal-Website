<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is John Rizzo I am an aspiring program developer on a journey of self improvement with a penchant for camping and hiking, and hobbies that include but are not limited to singing (I have been teaching myself for about 6 or so years now), playing Magic The Gathering, Video Games, Board Games, and many others. I look to the tech field to make my dreams of improving the mobile game market a reality (all those microtransactions, there has to be a better way!) as well as to join a constantly growing and ever changing field. </p>
